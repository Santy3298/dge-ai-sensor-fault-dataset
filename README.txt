README - Edge-AI Sensor Dataset for Real-Time Fault Prediction in Smart Manufacturing

Dataset Description:
This dataset simulates sensor readings from an industrial CNC environment and is designed for AI-driven fault prediction and process optimization. It contains multi-modal data including time-series sensor measurements, machine status annotations, and control logs from PLC systems.

Files Included:
1. vibration_data.csv - Vibration sensor readings (unit: g)
2. temperature_data.csv - Temperature sensor readings (unit: Â°C)
3. humidity_data.csv - Humidity sensor readings (unit: %)
4. pressure_data.csv - Pressure sensor readings (unit: Pa)
5. annotations.csv - Annotated machine status (normal, warning, failure)
6. plc_logs.csv - Control actions with actuator information and responses

Use Cases:
- Fault detection using AI models
- Predictive maintenance
- Sensor data visualization and anomaly detection
- PLC log analysis and digital twin simulations
